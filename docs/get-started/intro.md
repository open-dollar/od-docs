# Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new Keyp app**.

1. Create a new developer account.
2. Get an app ID.
3. Use any standard Oauth library to allow users to sign in with Keyp.
4. Hit our endpoints to airdrop some tokens to your users.

## Creating a developer account

Log in to https://dashboard.usekeyp.com

## Getting an App ID

In your dashboard, create a new `client_id`. You can create any number of these per developer account.

## Connecting Keyp accounts to your OAuth service

Letting your users log in with Keyp to access an EVM wallet is the same process of connecting with any other regular OAuth provider.

## Using requests to transfer or airdrop tokens
