# Welcome to Keyp 🍩

Keyp creates developer tools for game studios and app developers to improve the Web3 onboarding experience.

We want to create a future where people have universal ownership and autonomy over their digital assets.‍

After building dozens of apps - we realized we were missing an onboarding platform that could bring Web3 to everyone. In order to create more accessibility, we built the most interoperable and scalable onboarding platform for developers.


Checkout the [Quick Start](docs/get-started/intro.md) to get started.
