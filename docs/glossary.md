# Glossary

## APR
APR, or annual percentage rate, represents the yearly rate charged for borrowing.

## APY
APY, or annual percentage yield, refers to how much interest you earn and takes into account compound interest.

## Arbitrage
Arbitrage is the act of seeking to exploit price differences between markets to make “risk-free” gains. Arbitrageurs are individuals who benefit from price discrepancies while helping to align pegged token prices.

## Bridge
A bridge is a platform that allows for the transfer of blockchain assets from one network to another. For example, from mainnet Ethereum to the Arbitrum rollup.

## CEX
Centralized Exchange. Binance and Coinbase are examples of CEXs. Acting as centralized authorities, they take custody of a user’s funds on deposit.
Collateral
The assets that are deposited, such as wETH, in order to borrow another asset, such as $OD. 
Collateralization Ratio 
The collateralization ratio is the ratio between the US Dollar value of the collateral in a vault and its debt in $OD.
Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)
A collateralized debt position refers to the assets deposited into a lending protocol as collateral in order to borrow stablecoins, such as $OD. 
DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a type of organization that is run on blockchain or peer-to-peer networks and governed by rules encoded into smart contracts. They allow for decentralized, democratic governance and coordination of pooled funds and resources, without central management. The rules are transparent and autonomous once launched on blockchain.
Debt Amount
The number of borrowed tokens, for example $OD, required to redeem the collateral in a vault.
DeFi
DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, which refers to financial services and products that operate on public blockchains like Ethereum.
DEX
A DEX (decentralized exchange) is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows for peer-to-peer trading of digital assets and cryptocurrencies without the need for an intermediary or centralized authority.
Governance
Governance refers to the democratic process of managing a project or ecosystem by a collective of stakeholders who hold governance tokens which grant the power to submit proposals and vote.
Governance Token
A governance token gives holders voting rights to influence decisions in a decentralized protocol. Governance token holders can propose and vote on upgrades to the protocol.
Leverage
A method through which a user manages more money than what initially committed by taking debt.
Liquidation
Liquidation is when borrowed positions are forcefully closed if asset values fall below the Minimum Collateralization Ratio, in order to pay back the loans.
Liquidation Penalty
The liquidation penalty is a fee rendered on the price of assets of the collateral when liquidators purchase it as part of the liquidation of a loan that has passed the liquidation threshold
Liquidation Price
The liquidation price of a vault is the price at which the position becomes subject to liquidation. This happens when the collateral value drops below the Minimum Collateral Ratio (MCR) of 135%.
Liquidity
A measure of how much available circulating supply there is of an asset or currency, and the activity of that asset or currency in an exchange, economy, or network. A currency with low supply and/or circulation is said to be illiquid.
Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)
LSTs are tokens issued by liquid staking platforms, such as Lido or Rocketpool. They are also known as Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs). 
Loan-to-value (LTV)
The loan to value is the maximum amount of stablecoins debt compared with the collateral deposited in the vault. For example, if wETH's LTV is at 80%, a user depositing $10,000 worth of wETH can borrow up to 8000 $OD.
Non-Fungible Vault (NFV)
A Non-Fungible Vault is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) that is tied to and controlled by an NFT rather than an account, thereby enabling the transfer or sale of the CDP without requiring redemption with the borrowed $OD debt. 
OD
OD is Open Dollar’s stablecoin, a floating $1.00 pegged stablecoin backed by Liquid Staking Tokens with NFT controlled vaults. 
ODG
ODG is Open Dollar’s governance token which grants holders the ability to submit proposals and vote on the Open Dollar platform’s governance.
Over-collateralized
Over-collateralization means the value of locked collateral exceeds the value of stablecoins minted, reducing risk of liquidation.
Redemption
The act of burning a token to repossess the underlying collateral asset.
